 Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)
?

A lay person is a person who is not trained, qualified, or experienced in a particular subject or activity.
When I use command line I always have to tell command line what to do, and I always have to speak in right language (ex. check spelling, check cammands) so that they understand what I am talking about. I think command line is almost like a new worker who started to work together in the same store and I have to let them know what their task is. 


List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

ls- list directory    (you get list of files from the directory you are currently working in)
mkdir- make directory (you make new directory it is almost like right click create new file)
cd- change directory (you can move into other folders using cd foldername or cd .. to move up a folder)
pwd- print working directory (shows where user is located in within the directory)
rmdir-remove directory (delete folders using this command)
mv-move a file or directory (move files or directory mv this.txt devsacademy/ moved this.txt file to EDA folder)
Nano- Nano is command line text editor but you can only use it in command line
rm -r - -r stands for recursive and it is used to delete a directory and all of its child directories
cp-copy files (you move copied files to folders by.. cp this.txt devsacademy/)
*- Wildcard (selects all the file in the working directory)
env- you can see your environment (I think this kind of shows every details such as pwd,your working directory,username etc at one time)
